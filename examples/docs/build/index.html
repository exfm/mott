          <h2>about</h2>
          <p>
            mott was originally created to help build the exfm phonegap
            app.  it started out as a dozen or so grunt.js tasks.
            after open sourcing it, i realized there was a lot about
            that code that stunk; too fragile, too coupled to the
            exfm architecture, not reusable.  It could do more.
          </p>
          <p>
            originally i didn't want mott.  i justed wanted something
            that fit my work flow.  after months of bending other tools,
            i took some time to tear the original code down and
            figure out what it was i actually wanted.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>reuse amazing modules</li>
            <li>make the configuration as reusable as any other module</li>
          </ul>
          <p>the features i originally wanted</p>
          <ul>
            <li>browserify to simplify dependecy management</li>
            <li>robust client side templating</li>
            <li>`lang.json` support</li>
            <li>compress design assets</li>
            <li>incremental deploys to S3</li>
            <li>smoke test before deploying with `PhantomJS`</li>
            <li>helpers for debugging, particularly on mobile (`weinre`, `chrome debugger`)</li>
            <li>rebuild/reload on change</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            the point here is not just to create make in javascript.
            there are plenty of solutions that already do that.
            the raison d'etre of mott is to modularize the
            boilerplate and the configuration of that boilerplate.
            mott works great when used with make, grunt, jake, or
            any of the other make improvements.  i've actually
            added a few things already and removed them because they're
            just better in make or bash.
          </p>
          <p>
            similar to https://github.com/buildjs/bake-js https://github.com/buildjs/rigger http://brunch.io https://github.com/buildjs/recipe
            so whats the difference between mott and all of those?
          </p>
          <h2>the works</h2>
          <p>
            so, how does it all work?
            it may sound like a lot, but it's really not.
            the amount of code here is really reall tiny.
            it just provides an environment to play in.
            almost all of the action happens in steps.
            the basic unit is a step,
            say run browserify on some js files.  each step is
            assumed to be async and is as simple as a name and
            a callback.  the callback gets two arguments: a
            context, more on that later,
            and a done callback.
            i've already written some, in lib/tasks, which should
            be renamed lib/steps,
            to take care of my workflow.  these should probably
            be moved out of the main package but i digress.
            a context is like a request
            object
            in express.  its very thin api for a step to interact
            with the rest of the world.  contexts are mutable.
            other steps can pin on extra functionality (like dev
            server -> watch).
            before a context is ever handed to a step,
            it's prepared;
            globs are expanded to full paths, short hand options
            are blown up to their full version, unicorns
            and bubblegums
            rain from the heavens.  steps can then be bundled up
            into tasks.
            tasks and steps can be packaged up into nice little
            recipes; use requirejs and sass for this client,
            less and browserify and dust.js for this other guy,
            this one should be a phonegap app, etc, etc.
          </p>
          <h2>metadata</h2>
          <p>
            metadata is the
            runtime configuration for a recipe.  the metadata is what
            a context is originally built from.  your metadata is what
            specifies the tooling configuration for project;
            copy these png's from node_modules
            (node_modules/my-app-design-aseets/**/*.png)
            and put them in /images/$1/$2.png (see what i did
            there?), run js/main.js through browserify and spit
            that out as app.js, all simple things you could do
            in the makes.  steps and recipes can also modify
            metadata to
            abstract away more tooling configuration; copy
            the bootstrap glyphs to build/img/, compile
            posts/*.jade templates and put them in build/post/$1,
            create permalinks in S3 website configuration
            for all of my blog posts, etc.
          </p>
          <h2>environments</h2>
          <p>
            you can also specify
            different environments that override
            config values (deploy to this S3 bucket for
            production, and this one for staging).  steps can
            also as expected easily do different things for
            different environments; add sourcemaps to
            browserify'd files in development,
            minfiy css for production.
          </p>
          <h2>cookbooks</h2>
          <p>
            cookbooks bring it all together and are an api for
            working with your project (note: a project could
            have many apps, ie mobile web and phonegap ios and
            chrome package app.  i like modularization a lot,
            but you shouldn't have to use it for all your
            apps. a common folder is the best sometimes.)
            cookbook.exec() will run a task with some options,
            cookbook.cli() will run as a cli.
          </p>
          <p>
            you start up a cookbook by providing it "recipes"
            that define how your project should be tooled,
            "config" which are values you want accessible in
            your app code and/or your tooling, and "environments"
            which can override config values as discussed above.
          </p>
          <p>as little configuration to it as you want.
            <pre><code>require('mott').starter().cli();</code></pre>eventually you'll be down to
            <pre><code>
                require('mott')
                .cook(require('my-usual-setup')).cli();</code></pre>and that one line of code will do all sorts of
            crazy things!
            and you can manage it through package.json!
            <pre><code>
                "dependencies": {
                    "mott": "0.1.0",

                }</code></pre>
