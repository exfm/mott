This site is built using mott.</p><p>mott was originally created to help build the exfm phonegap
app.  it started out as a dozen or so grunt.js tasks.
after open sourcing it, i realized there was a lot about
that code that stunk; too fragile, too coupled to the
exfm architecture, not reusable.  It could do more.</p><p>originally i didn't want mott.  i justed wanted something
that fit my work flow.  after months of bending other tools,
i took some time to tear the original code down and
figure out what it was i actually wanted.</p><ul><li>reuse amazing modules</li><li>make the configuration as reusable as any other module</li></ul><p>the features i originally wanted</p><ul><li>browserify to simplify dependecy management</li><li>robust client side templating</li><li>`lang.json` support</li><li>compress design assets</li><li>incremental deploys to S3</li><li>smoke test before deploying with `PhantomJS`</li><li>helpers for debugging, particularly on mobile (`weinre`, `chrome debugger`)</li><li>rebuild/reload on change</li></ul><p>the point here is not just to create make in javascript.
there are plenty of solutions that already do that.
the raison d'etre of mott is to modularize the
boilerplate and the configuration of that boilerplate.
mott works great when used with make, grunt, jake, or
any of the other make improvements.  i've actually
added a few things already and removed them because they're
just better in make or bash.</p><p>as little configuration to it as you want.<pre><code>require('mott').starter().cli();</code></pre>eventually you'll be down to<pre><code>require('mott')
.cook(require('my-usual-setup')).cli();</code></pre>and that one line of code will do all sorts of
crazy things!
and you can manage it through package.json!<pre><code>"dependencies": {
    "mott": "0.1.0",
    "my-usual-setup": "git://github.com/imlucas/mott-my-usual-setup.git"
}</code></pre></p><p>so, how does it all work?
it may sound like a lot, but it's really not.
the amount of code here is really reall tiny.
it just provides an environment to play in.
almost all of the action happens in steps.
the basic unit is a step,
say run browserify on some js files.  each step is
assumed to be async and is as simple as a name and
a callback.  the callback gets two arguments: a
context, more on that later,
and a done callback.
i've already written some, in lib/tasks, which should
be renamed lib/steps,
to take care of my workflow.  these should probably
be moved out of the main package but i digress.
a context is like a request
object
in express.  its very thin api for a step to interact
with the rest of the world.  contexts are mutable.
other steps can pin on extra functionality (like dev
server -> watch).
before a context is ever handed to a step,
it's prepared;
globs are expanded to full paths, short hand options
are blown up to their full version, unicorns
and bubblegums
rain from the heavens.  steps can then be bundled up
into tasks, to be run in parallel or run
sequentially.
tasks and steps can be packaged up into nice little
recipes; use requirejs and sass for this client,
less and browserify and dust.js for this other guy,
this one should be a phonegap app, etc, etc.</p><p>tpl (which really, really needs another name) is the
runtime configuration for a recipe.  the tpl is what
a context is originally built from.  your tpl is what
specifies the tooling configuration for project;
copy these png's from node_modules
(node_modules/my-app-design-aseets/**/*.png)
and put them in /images/$1/$2.png (see what i did
there?), run js/main.js through browserify and spit
that out as app.js, all simple things you could do
in the makes.</p><p>(environments are wip) you can also specify
different environments that override
config values (deploy to this S3 bucket for
production, and this one for staging).  steps can
also as expected easily do different things for
different environments; add sourcemaps to
browserify'd files in development,
minfiy css for production.</p><p>cookbooks bring it all together and are an api for
working with your project (note: a project could
have many apps, ie mobile web and phonegap ios and
chrome package app.  i like modularization a lot,
but you shouldn't have to use it for all your
apps. a common folder is the best sometimes.)
cookbook.exec() will run a task with some options,
cookbook.cli() will run as a cli.</p><p>you start up a cookbook by providing it "apps"
(should these be refactored to recipes? thats
what they are.  configured instances of recipes.)
that define how your project should be tooled,
"config" which are values you want accessible in
your app code and/or your tooling, and "environments"
which can override config values as discussed above.</p></div></div><div class="row-fluid marketing"><div class="span4"><h4>this site</h4><p>Simple jade templates, less, and bootstrap</p></div><div class="span4"><h4>phonegap</h4><p>less, browserify, and cordova</p></div><div class="span3"><h4>hmmm</h4><p>dont know yet</p></div></div></div></div><script src="socket.io/socket.io.js"></script><script src="app.js"></script></html>
