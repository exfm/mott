This site is built using mott.</p><p>mott was originally created to help build the exfm phonegap
app.  it started out as a dozen or so grunt.js tasks.
after open sourcing it, i realized there was a lot about
that code that stunk; too fragile, too coupled to the
exfm architecture, not reusable.  It could do more.</p><p>originally i didn't want mott.  i justed wanted something
that fit my work flow.  after months of bending other tools,
i took some time to tear the original code down and
figure out what it was i actually wanted.</p><ul><li>reuse amazing modules</li><li>make the configuration as reusable as any other module</li></ul><p>the features i originally wanted</p><ul><li>browserify to simplify dependecy management</li><li>robust client side templating</li><li>`lang.json` support</li><li>compress design assets</li><li>incremental deploys to S3</li><li>smoke test before deploying with `PhantomJS`</li><li>helpers for debugging, particularly on mobile (`weinre`, `chrome debugger`)</li><li>rebuild/reload on change</li></ul><p>the point here is not just to create make in javascript.
there are plenty of solutions that already do that.
the raison d'etre of mott is to modularize the
boilerplate and the configuration of that boilerplate.
mott works great when used with make, grunt, jake, or
any of the other make improvements.  i've actually
added a few things already and removed them because they're
just better in make or bash.</p><p>as little configuration to it as you want.<pre><code>require('mott').starter().cli();</code></pre>eventually you'll be down to<pre><code>require('mott').cook(require('my-usual-setup')).cli();</code></pre>and that one line of code will do all sorts of crazy things!
and you can manage it through package.json<pre><code>"dependencies": {
    "mott": "0.1.0",
    "my-usual-setup": "git://github.com/imlucas/mott-my-usual-setup.git"
}</code></pre></p><p>so, how does it all work?  the basic unit is a step,
say run browserify on some js files.  each step is
assumed to be async and is as simple as a name and
a callback.  the callback gets two arguments: a context, more on that later,
and a done callback.  a context is like a request object
in express.  its very thin api for a step to interact
with the rest of the world.  contexts are mutable.
other steps can pin on extra functionality (like dev server -> watch).
before a context is ever handed to a step, it's prepared;
globs are expanded to full paths, short hand options
are blown up to their full version, unicorns and bubblegums
rain from the heavens.  steps can then be bundled up
into tasks, to be run in parallel or run sequentially.</p><p>(environments are wip) you can also specify different environments that override
config values (deploy to this S3 bucket for production,
and this one for staging).  steps can also as expected
easily do different things for different environments;
add sourcemaps to browserify'd files in development,
minfiy css for production.</p></div></div><div class="row-fluid marketing"><div class="span4"><h4>this site</h4><p>Simple jade templates, less, and bootstrap</p></div><div class="span4"><h4>phonegap</h4><p>less, browserify, and cordova</p></div><div class="span3"><h4>hmmm</h4><p>dont know yet</p></div></div></div></div><script src="socket.io/socket.io.js"></script><script src="app.js"></script></html>
