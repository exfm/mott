<h2>huh?  what is it good for?</h2>

<ul>
<li>build and run phonegap apps</li>
<li>browserify</li>
<li>less</li>
<li>rebuild on change</li>
<li>build pages with jade</li>
<li>appcache</li>
<li>deploy an opsworks stack</li>
<li>deploy to S3</li>
<li>deploy to github pages</li>
</ul>

<h2>getting started</h2>

<pre><code># install mott from npm
npm install -g mott
&amp;nbsp;
# initialize a new project
mott new my-app
&amp;nbsp;
cd my-app;
# starts a local development server on localhost:8080
npm start
&amp;nbsp;
# setup repo
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-app.git
git add package.json
git commit -m "Initial commit."
&amp;nbsp;
# deploy to github pages
npm run-script deploy
</code></pre>

<p>to add to an existing project, create or add this to package.json</p>

<pre><code>"dependencies": {
    "mott": "0.1.x",
    "mott-starter": "0.0.x"
},
"mott": {
    "recipe": {
        "use": "mott-starter",
        "metadata": {}
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>package.json</h2>

<p>so how does mott find out about all of this stuff?
the world doesnt need another configuration file or
format.  we already have a package.json file
and so mott just uses that.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "name": "my-app",
    "version": "0.0.0",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "DEBUG=mott:* ./node_modules/.bin/mott run",
        "deploy": "DEBUG=mott:* ./node_modules/.bin/mott deploy"
    }
    "dependencies": {
        "mott": "0.1.0",
        "mott-starter": "0.0.1"
    },
    "mott": {
        "recipe": {
            "use": "mott-starter"
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>all keys specified in mott.recipe above are specific to
your application.  the special key mott.recipe.metadata
contains your setup, described in more detail below.
another special key is use, which allows you to specify
one of more recipes to inherit from.  all other keys
of mott.recipe.* are task declarations, which again you
can find more about below.</p>

<p>all keys specified in mott.*, excluding mott.recipe,
are environments you can create. for example</p>

<pre><code>...
"mott": {
    "recipe": {
        "use": "mott-starter"
    },
    "production": {
       "url": "http://ex.fm",
       "deploy": "s3://myaccessid:secretkey@bucketname/subkey"
    }
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>so when you specify NODE_ENV or --env from the command line,
these values will override values in mott.recipe.metadata.</p>

<h2>package-local.json</h2>

<p>sometimes you have values you don't want to be checked in
to your repository;  for example, AWS API credentials.
for those types of cases, mott supports a package-local.json
file you can use to specify those values.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "mott": {
        "production": {
            "deploy": "s3://myaccessid:secretkey@bucketname/subkey"
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>deploying with <a href="http://wercker.com">wercker</a></h2>

<p>set up your repo as a wercker application and use the below
as your wercker.yml</p>

<pre><code># mott wercker.yml
box: wercker/nodejs
build:
  steps:
    - npm-install
deploy:
  steps:
    -  script:
        name: mott-deploy
        code: |-
          npm run-script deploy
</code></pre>

<h2>versioning with <a href="http://github.com/imlucas/node-sterno">sterno</a></h2>

<p>sterno provides a simple way to manage versioning
for mobile deployments.  if appcache worked, sterno wouldn't
need to exist.  mott has a built-in step for generating
sterno bootstrap files.</p>

<pre><code>...
"mott": {
    "recipe": {
        "use": "mott-starter",
        "build": ["write bootstrap"]
    }
}
...
</code></pre>

<h2>adhoc steps</h2>

<p>a step does not have to be defined in a recipe to be used by your app.  you can just include a path to a script like
<a href="https://github.com/imlucas/mott/blob/master/examples/docs/mott/fix-bootstrap-img-paths.js">this site does</a></p>

<pre><code>...
"mott": {
    "recipe": {
        "use": "mott-starter",
        "build": ["./mott/fix-bootstrap-img-paths.js"]
    }
}
...
</code></pre>

<h2>cordova</h2>

<p>mott was built specifically for working with phonegap/cordova apps so it has
pretty extensive integration out of the box.  wouldn't it be nice if
you could run one command, build your app, create a binary distribution and
a manifest to install it, create a nice looking install page to send users to
and upload it all to S3?  mott can do this for cordvoa.</p>

<ul>
<li>simple add on to build step for copying to <code>www</code> in your native directory</li>
<li>generate PLIST and IPA files for adhoc distribution</li>
<li>launch app in the emulator</li>
</ul>

<h3>ipa</h3>

<h3>build for ipa</h3>

<h2>deploying</h2>

<p>mott drops all of the output created by your app in the <code>./build/</code> directory.
this makes deploying your app after a build pretty simple</p>

<h3>github</h3>

<p>add the deploy step with <code>deploy to github</code></p>

<pre><code>...
"mott": {
    "recipe": {
        "use": "mott-starter",
        "deploy": ["build", "deploy to github"]
    }
}
...
</code></pre>

<h3>s3</h3>

<p>do incremental deploys to an S3 bucket with the <code>deploy to s3</code> step and the
<code>deploy</code> metadata key.</p>

<pre><code>...
"mott": {
    "recipe": {
        "use": "mott-starter",
        "deploy": ["build", "deploy to s3"],
        "metadata": {
            "deploy": "s3://accessKeyId:secret@bucket/optionalSubKey"
        }
    }
}
...
</code></pre>

<h3>opsworks stack</h3>

<p>create a new deployment with the <code>deploy opsworks stack</code> step and the
<code>opsworks stack</code> metadata key.</p>

<pre><code>...
"mott": {
    "recipe": {
        "use": "mott-starter",
        "deploy": ["build", "deploy opsworks stack"],
        "metadata": {
            "opsworks stack": "api-stack"
        }
    }
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>you can optionally provide <code>opsworks comment</code> and/or <code>opsworks data</code> that will
also be sent to the create deployment call.</p>

<h2>about</h2>

<p>mott was originally created to help build the exfm phonegap
app.  it started out as a dozen or so grunt.js tasks.
after open sourcing it, i realized there was a lot about
that code that stunk; too fragile, too coupled to the
exfm architecture, not reusable.  It could do more.</p>

<p>originally i didn't want mott.  i justed wanted something
that fit my work flow.  after months of bending other tools,
i took some time to tear the original code down and
figure out what it was i actually wanted.</p>

<ul>
<li>reuse amazing modules</li>
<li>make the configuration as reusable as any other module</li>
<li>composable configuration</li>
</ul>

<p>the features i originally wanted</p>

<ul>
<li>browserify to simplify dependecy management</li>
<li>robust client side templating</li>
<li><code>lang.json</code> support</li>
<li>compress design assets</li>
<li>incremental deploys to S3</li>
<li>smoke test before deploying with <code>PhantomJS</code></li>
<li>helpers for debugging, particularly on mobile (<code>weinre</code>, <code>chrome debugger</code>)</li>
<li>rebuild/reload on change</li>
</ul>

<p>the point here is not just to create make in javascript.
there are plenty of solutions that already do that.
the raison d'etre of mott is to modularize the
boilerplate and the configuration of that boilerplate.
mott works great when used with make, grunt, jake, or
any of the other make improvements.  i've actually
added a few things already and removed them because they're
just better in make or bash.</p>

<h2>the works</h2>

<p>so, how does it all work?
it may sound like a lot, but it's really not.
the amount of code here is really reall tiny.
it just provides an environment to play in.
almost all of the action happens in steps.
the basic unit is a step,
say run browserify on some js files.  each step is
assumed to be async and is as simple as a name and
a callback.  the callback gets two arguments: a
context, more on that later,
and a done callback.</p>

<p>i've already written some, in lib/steps
to take care of my workflow.  these should probably
be moved out of the main package but i digress.
steps can then be bundled up
into tasks.
tasks and steps can be packaged up into nice little
recipes; use requirejs and sass for this client,
less and browserify and dust.js for this other guy,
this one should be a phonegap app, etc, etc.</p>

<h3>recipe.metadata</h3>

<p>metadata is the
runtime configuration for a recipe.
your metadata is what
specifies the tooling configuration for project.
for example, to tell mott
copy these png's from node<em>modules
(node</em>modules/my-app-design-aseets/<em>*/</em>.png)
and put them in /images/$1/$2.png (see what i did
there?), run js/main.js through browserify and spit
that out as app.js you would want metadata like</p>

<pre><code>{
    ...
    "mott": {
        "recipe": {
            "metadata": {
                "js": {
                    "./main.js": "./app.js"
                },
                "includes": {
                    "node_modules/bootstrap/img/*.png": "img/$1.png"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h3>recipe.environments</h3>

<p>you can also specify
different environments that override
config values (deploy to this S3 bucket for
production, and this one for staging).  steps can
also as expected easily do different things for
different environments; add sourcemaps to
browserify'd files in development,
minfiy css for production.</p>

<h3>recipe.cookbook</h3>

<p>cookbooks bring it all together and are an api for
working with your project (note: a project could
have many recipes, ie mobile web and phonegap ios and
chrome package app.  i like modularization a lot,
but you shouldn't have to use it for all your
recipes. a common folder is the best sometimes.)
cookbook.exec() will run a task with some options,
cookbook.cli() will run as a cli.</p>

<p>the cookbook prepares your metadata and environment
to create a context and takes care of things like
expanding globs you specify in your metadata.</p>

<h3>recipe.ctx</h3>

<p>environments override metadata to create a context.
the context is like a request object in express or
the env object if your coming from fabric and python.
ctx can be decorated with functions by recipes and steps.</p>

<p>ctx also contains a few helper functions that make
writing steps much easier.  you can find more
on that in the Context documentation.</p>
